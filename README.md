# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTM for Algorithmic Trading - Simple Time Series Forecasting


RNN are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data. RNN are ideal for sequential data such as financial data, because the algorithm is architected to remember its input values. It can remember the input values due to its internal memory.

You would probably ask yourself at this point, why a previous sample of financial data is important, because Browning Motion states that future variation of the stock price are independent from the past. So it is actually impossible to predict exactly future stock price otherwise we would all become financially wealthy.

Yes, and I would agree on that statement, that it is impossible to predict exact future price, but on the other site you can analyze the candle patterns to identify Price Actions. Price Actions will reveal to you what the market is thinking and predict with high probability Uptrends or Downtrends in the market. 

The most convenient way to analyze price actions is to use candlestick charts. Candlesticks are a reflection of what buyers and sellers are doing.

Letâ€™s have a quick look on the chart to understand what is meant by price action...
